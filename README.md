Run blender as administrator first so you can install beautifulsoup which is needed. Once this is installed, you can then run my script or install as an addon.

File > Import > Text from URL

1. Launch Blender as Administrator.
2. Go to scripting and copy paste the bs.py file from this github and run it.
3. Done. Now you can simply close out of administrator blender or continue if you want and install my plugin
